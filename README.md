## Introduction
Travelling is a major thing that people used to reduce stresses with their busy schedules.

Selecting a proper location to travel is one of the major problems where people get stuck when planning on travelling.

As a solution to this problem, we developed a mobile application that helps travellers to get an idea about locations around the world through this project.

## Proposed Solution

- Share New Location Data with a Review about that place

## Registering Users to the Application

- A new user can register to the application with a valid email, username, password ,age and address.
- Login
- Forget password

## Search Location
 **1. List view**
 A Registered user can search and find the details of the required locations.
